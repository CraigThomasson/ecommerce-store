    * BUSSINESS MODEL
        * This business is a small independent store that operates on a B2C bases. The store is intended to be a secondary income for the store owner to make small profits from their      hobbyist candle making. 
        A real world example would be a small Etsy store owner that wanted more control over there website and profits
    * Marketing
        * As a small business thier main marketing strategy would be to utilise a business Facebook page and the owners Facebook friends network to promote there store.
            As the candles are vegan and ethically sourced, they could also target Facebook groups with similar views and ethics to sell their goods to. A mock Facebook page can be seen [here](/workspace/ecommerce-store/readme_docs/images/facebook_template/facebook_template.png)
    * SEO
        * The site has a meta description and key words that are relevant to the sites product and goals and should help with SEO.
The site has a sitemap.xml and a robots.txt file in the route directory
Although the site has a minimalist approach in its design and layout the addition of an about page enables the owner of the store to write about their store and goals without obstructing the flow, quality and usability of the main site. The text here has been optimised to promote key words and searchability without detracting from the quality and message of the text. 
There was also opportunity to share links to high-ranking external sites with relevant information
The blog page is also a great place for the site owner to update the users and keep relevant and up to date information the page.
