# CandleKeep

 ## Project overview
CandleKeep is an ecommerce application designed to enable a small one-person business to sell handmade candles via there own ecommerce website. 
You can view the deployed site [here](https://candlekeep-pp5.herokuapp.com/).

## Agile
User stories where use used to inform the scope and functionality need for this project as well as using Kanban board in git hub projects the track the progress of features as they get developed and implemented

## Strategy
* Goals
    * Site owner goals
        * To sell their hand made candles on their own ecommerce store.
        * To display images of their products.
        * To be able to add, edit and delete products
        * To make product sales through the website
        * To have a clean easy to use and navigate website. 
        * To interact with there user through blogs, reviews, newsletter.
    * Customer goals:
        * To find products easily that they would want to purchase.
        * For the site to have clear and easy navigation
        * To be able to review their purchase before fulfilling payment.
        * To be able to edit and update their purchase before fulfilling payment.
        * To leave reviews of products.
        * To update, edit and delete their Reviews.
## BUSSINESS MODEL
    * This business is a small independent store that operates on a B2C bases. The store is intended to be a secondary income for the store owner to make small profits from their      hobbyist candle making. 
    A real world example would be a small Etsy store owner that wanted more control over there website and profits
## Marketing
    * As a small business thier main marketing strategy would be to utilise a business Facebook page and the owners Facebook friends network to promote there store.
        As the candles are vegan and ethically sourced, they could also target Facebook groups with similar views and ethics to sell their goods to. A mock Facebook page can be seen [here](readme_docs/images/facebook_template/facebook_template.png)
## SEO
    * The site has a meta description and key words that are relevant to the sites product and goals and should help with SEO.
    <br/>
    <img src="readme_docs/images/meta_data/meta.PNG" alt="image of lode page">
    <br/>
    The site has a sitemap.xml and a robots.txt file in the route directory
    Although the site has a minimalist approach in its design and layout the addition of an about page enables the owner of the store to write about their store and goals without obstructing the flow, quality and usability of the main site. The text here has been optimised to promote key words and searchability without detracting from the quality and message of the text. 
    There was also opportunity to share links to high-ranking external sites with relevant information
    The blog page is also a great place for the site owner to update the users and keep relevant and up to date information the page. 
## Structure
    * The site has been built with 7 apps(including the sites main app)  that each deals with a different area of the stores core functionality. 
    From a UX design point of view the site is structured so the user can easily and intuitively move from finding the right product to purchase and completing check out. Meeting the primary goal of both the site owner and the customer.
        1. This is achieved by having the shop now button take prominence on the home page then having clear and easy navigation to complete a purchase. 
        2. Once items have been added to the bag users can see the bag icon and total in the main navigation. This is standard practice across most ecommerce sites(for example amazon) so it will be intuitive for the user to click here to move to there bag. 
        3. Once one the shopping bag page the button to go to checkout it is clearly visible.
        4. The checkout page shows the user a clear summery of what they are going to purchase and strips payment form is clear for the user to see to complete their purchase 
* Database

## Design choices 
All the colours in use on this site were picked using https://imagecolorpicker.com/en.  the colours where taken from the background image that is used site wide. 
    * Overlay color = rgba(217,200,191,0.6) this colour was picked from the background of the man image and user as an over to mute the image and help make text pop. 
    * Title font colour #2a0406; this shade was also picked from the background image. It is only used sparingly for the sight name and some title. The colour is very subtle and is a barely noticeable touch that brings the sight together without the user even realising.
    Two google fonts were used for the title â€˜Montserrat Alternatesâ€™ and â€˜Work Sansâ€™
    These font work well together and give the log text a unique feel.
